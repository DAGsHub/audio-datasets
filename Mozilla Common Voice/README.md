## Brief description of datasets

Here is a brief description of what is included in the Urban Sound 8k Dataset audio data:

An open-source, multi-language dataset of voices that anyone can use to train speech-enabled applications.

Each entry in the dataset consists of a unique MP3 and corresponding text file. Many of the 13,905 recorded hours in the dataset also include demographic metadata like age, sex, and accent that can help train the accuracy of speech recognition engines.

The dataset currently consists of 11,192 validated hours in 76 languages, but we’re always adding more voices and languages.
