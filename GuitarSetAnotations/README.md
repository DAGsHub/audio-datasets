-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


### OVERVIEW

This project was lead by Qingyang Xi at NYU's Music and Audio Research Lab, along with Rachel Bittner, Xuzhou Ye and Juan Pablo Bello from the same lab, as well as Johan Pauwels at the Center for Digital Music at Queen Mary University.

We present GuitarSet, a dataset that provides high-quality guitar recordings alongside rich annotations and metadata.
In particular, by recording guitars using a hexaphonic pickup, we are able to not only provide recordings of the individual strings but also to largely automate the expensive annotation process, therefore providing rich annotation.
The dataset contains recordings of a variety of musical excerpts played on an acoustic guitar, along with time-aligned annotations of pitch contours, string and fret positions, chords, beats, downbeats, and playing style.



### FILE FORMAT

Metadata is provided in metadata.csv. This file consists of one record per
line, delimited by the pipe character (0x7c). The fields are:

  1. ID: this is the name of the corresponding .wav file
  2. Transcription: words spoken by the reader (UTF-8)
  3. Normalized Transcription: transcription with numbers, ordinals, and
     monetary units expanded into full words (UTF-8).

Each audio file is a single-channel 16-bit PCM WAV with a sample rate of
22050 Hz.



### STATISTICS

## What do you track?

We track two types of events:

Visits to a record page.
Downloads of a file.
For both types of events, we track:

Visitor: An anonymized visitor ID.
Visitor type: If the request was made by a) human, b) machine or c) robot.
Country: The country of origin of the request (based on the IP address).
Referrer: The referrer domain.
